    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Strawberries stuffed with lightly-sweetened cream cheese and walnuts are perfect for that romantic evening. 
       They go great with champagne! Pecans also work well in this recipe. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="center-list">
      <li>20 fresh strawberries</li>
      <li>1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped walnuts</li>
      <li>1Â½ tablespoons confectioners' sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="center-list">
      <li>Dice two strawberries and set aside. Cut the stems off of each of the remaining strawberries, 
          forming a base for strawberries to stand on. Starting at the pointed ends and cutting most of 
          the way, but not completely through the stem end, slice each strawberry into four wedges.</li>
      <li>Beat the cream cheese until fluffy; stir in the diced strawberries, walnuts, and powdered sugar. 
          Spoon or pipe about a teaspoon of mix into each strawberry.</li>
    </ol>
