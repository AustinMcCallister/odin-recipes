    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Instead of just plain white cupcakes, I took it a step further and made them special. 
       You can change the colors for any holiday. Shades of green for St. Patrick's Day, pastel colors for Easter, 
       red white and blue for the 4th of July. You get the picture.</p>
