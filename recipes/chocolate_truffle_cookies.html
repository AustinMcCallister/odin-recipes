    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A very dark, rich chocolate cookie for the true chocoholic. This recipe uses relatively little flour, 
       resulting in dense, fudge-like cookies. These cookies keep well in the freezer (but you may have a hard 
       time waiting for them to thaw before you eat them).</p>
